	As a Researcher, my Research interest is in Natural medicine and Toxicology studies. 
And as a Bee enthusiast with so much curiousity about insect,I train interested student in Bee-keeping and honey 
harvesting activities professionally. 
 I believe acquiring knowledge and skills are not just enough to succeed without good network as an Entrepreneur and in life.
	My interest in Entrepreneurship and curiosity make me want to learn new things and teach others as a Teacher. 
So recently, I decided learning software engineering and software Testing. 
	I know continuous learning can help me build strong problem solving skills which will create value for me in Tech. 
I am looking forward to having a successful journey as a Software Tester and in Tech.I want to create a niche using my 
Teaching experiences in Tech as I grow.
